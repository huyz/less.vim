# Filename:         m
# Version:          0.2
# Description:
#   Pages through files as with `less` but with `vim` instead, giving you vim's
#   full colored syntax highlighting and vim commands if you need them.
#   Even standard input gets syntax highlighting, if recognizable.
#   It also acts as `less -F` and quits out immediately if a single file
#   has less than a screenful.
#   This file itself is an improved version of less.sh that is distributed with
#   vim.
#
# Platforms:        GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows Cygwin (not yet tested)
# Depends:          vim
# Source:           https://github.com/huyz/less.vim
# Author:           Huy Z  http://huyz.us/
# Updated on:       2011-07-04
# Created on:       2002-07-05
#
# Installation:
# 1. Install a recent vim, if necessary
# 2. Move or symlink 'm' into your path
# 3. Move or symlink 'less.vim' into the same directory as 'm' or
#    into your ~/.vim/macros directory
#
# Usage:
# - To page through one or more files:
#   m file...
# - To page standard input, just pipe as usual:
#   grep function ~/.zshrc | m
# - Hit 'h' to see help; key mappings are similar to `less`
#
# TODO:
# - also quit immediately if stdin is less than a screenful.
